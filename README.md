# For example...

### Create an example of an MVVM architecture implemented in C++20 QML and Qt6, where the model is a simulated EKG of a human heart beat. Use QWT for plotting the graphs. The view controller allows scrolling and zooming of the rendered plot and provides a way to measure the heart rate found in the data sample.
